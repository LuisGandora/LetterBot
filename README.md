Picking the perfect movie to watch is difficult. Flipping through the genres takes much too long, especially when you have a bowl of snacks waiting to be eaten. Don't let movie night be ruined by indecisiveness, 
LetterBot is here to save movie night. According to a study by Nielsen, (https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2023/nielsens-state-of-play-report-delivers-new-insights-as-streamings-next-evolution-brings-content-
discovery-challenges-for-viewers), viewers spend roughly 10 minutes on average searching for the "right" movie. Where using LetterBot would get you the perfect movie night every time in a matter of a couple minutes. 
LetterBot is here to help across all viewer demographics.

Our idea is to create a Letterboxd Web Scraper to search through and compare movies by genre and general ratings and return a list of movies according to the user's input. Our tool will allow viewers to drastically 
decrease the time they waste searching for a movie and more time enjoying their perfect movie of the night. 

We orignally worked on making this a data scraper for LinkedIn, but LinkedIn doesn't really allow us to do that without drawbacks. So we switched gear and decided to scrape Letterboxd and make a tool to help movie enjoyers more efiiciently choose a movie that fits their preferences of that moment.
